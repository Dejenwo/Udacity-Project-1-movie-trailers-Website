STEP 2. Download Entertainment_center.py, media.py and fresh_tomatoes.py to your local machine and unzip them all into any folder you want.
STEP 3. Open the Python Gui (IDLE) from your system menu and open entertainment_center.py from file and RUN it.
NOTE: The first component of this project is a list of lists of movie data is known as Entertainment_center.py. The second component is media.py. Media.py gives general formatting and structure to the lists in Entertainment_center.py. Lastly, Fresh_tomatoes.py compiles the lists in Entertaimnent_center.py utilizing the structure of media.py to create an organized .html file.
