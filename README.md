# PROJECT 1-MOVIE TRAILER WEBSITE  
Udacity Full Stack web developer Nanodegree Project 1 Movie Trailer website where users can see my favorite movies and watch the trailers. I have written server-side code to store a list of my favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. This project provides a python class to assemble arrays into a simple server-side script to generate a website.



 
# STEPS TO RUN

 -  Install Python 2.7.9 or higher 
  - Download the code
  - Extract compressed file
  - Open terminal and cd to the extracted folder
  - Run the application, `python entertainment_center.py`
  - This will open up a page in your web browser
  - Hover over the Movie Tile to view short Movie Storyline (my addition)
  - Click on the Movie Tile to see youtube trailer
  
# WHAT IS INCLUDED
Excluding this `README.md` file there are three python files:

  - **entertainment_center.py** - The main entry to the program. Builds the movie list and calls the method to generate
   the web page.
  - **fresh_tomatoes.py** - The provided web page generator. It takes in a list of movies and builds the `HTML` and opens up
  your default browser to display the generated `HTML` page.
  - **media.py** - Contains the class that provides the data structure to hold movie information.
  
A fourth file, `fresh_tomatoes.html`, will be generated when you run the program as described above. 
This file is the actual web page you would see in your browser.
